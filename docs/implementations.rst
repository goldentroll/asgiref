Application Frameworks
======================

Django/Channels
---------------

*Stable* / http://channels.readthedocs.io

Channels is the Django project to add asynchronous support to Django and is the
original driving force behind the ASGI project. Supports HTTP and WebSockets
with Django integration, and any protocol with ASGI-native code.


FastAPI

FastAPI is an ASGI web framework (made with Starlette) for building web APIs based on
standard Python type annotations and standards like OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and OAuth2.
Supports HTTP and WebSockets.


Quart
-----

*Beta* / https://github.com/pgjones/quart

Quart is a Python ASGI web microframework. It is intended to provide the easiest
way to use asyncio functionality in a web context, especially with existing Flask apps.
Supports HTTP.


Starlette
---------

*Beta* / https://github.com/encode/starlette

Starlette is a minimalist ASGI library for writing against basic but powerful
``Request`` and ``Response`` classes. Supports HTTP.


rpc.py
------

*Beta* / https://github.com/abersheeran/rpc.py

An easy-to-use and powerful RPC framework. RPC server base on WSGI & ASGI, client base 
on ``httpx``. Supports synchronous functions, asynchronous functions, synchronous 
generator functions, and asynchronous generator functions. Optional use of Type hint 
for type conversion. Optional OpenAPI document generation.
